         <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
         <p>If you think every bowl of chili should be hidden under mounds of melty cheese and a big dollop of sour cream, this is the casserole for you. With roasted sweet potatoes and black bean chili layered together under a gooey blanket of cheese, this easy vegetarian weeknight dinner is both incredibly comforting and surprisingly hearty.</p>
         
         <h3>Ingredients</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>4 tbsp. vegetable oil, divided, plus more for dish</li>
            <li>3 medium sweet potatoes (about 1 1/2 lb. total), peeled and cut into 1/2" cubes</li>

            <li> 1 1/2 tsp. kosher salt</li>

            <li>1 yellow onion, finely chopped</li>

            <li>1 red bell pepper, seeds and ribs removed, finely chopped</li>

            <li>2 cloves garlic, finely chopped</li>

            <li>1 tbsp. chili powder</li>

            <li>1 tbsp. ground cumin</li>

            <li>1 tsp. dried oregano</li>

            <li>1 (14.5-oz.) can black beans</li>

            <li>1 (14.5-oz.) can diced tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 (14.5-oz.) can tomato sauce</li>
            <li>1 c. fresh or frozen corn kernels</li>
            <li>2 c. shredded colby Jack cheese</li>
            <li>2 scallions, sliced (about 1/4 cup)</li>
            <li>Sour cream, for serving</li>
         </ul>
      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400°. Rub a 13"-by-9" glass baking dish with oil. On a baking sheet, toss potatoes, 2 tablespoons oil, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
        <li>Roast potatoes until lightly browned and cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes. Let cool slightly. Reduce oven temperature to 350°.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, in a large skillet over medium heat, heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil. Add onion and 1/2 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly softened, 3 to 4 minutes. Add bell pepper, garlic, chili powder, cumin, and oregano and cook, stirring occasionally, until pepper is just slightly softened and spices are fragrant, about 2 minutes more. Stir in beans, tomatoes, tomato sauce, corn, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour half of chili into prepared dish. Sprinkle with half of potatoes. Top with remaining chili and potatoes.</li>
        <li>Cover with foil and bake casserole until bubbling around the edges and hot in the center, 20 to 25 minutes. Uncover, top with cheese, and continue to bake until cheese is melted, 4 to 6 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle with scallions and serve with sour cream alongside.  </li>
      </ol>
